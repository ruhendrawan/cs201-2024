# Week 5

## Working with debugger

A debugger is used to find and fix errors in software. 

We understand and solve problems:
- pause a program, check what it's doing, and see where things might go wrong. 
- examine the values of variables
- move through your code step by step.

1. Set Breakpoints
2. Click on debug (Gear Icon)
3. Inspect or watch the variable
4. Go to the next line, next breakpoint, and stop
