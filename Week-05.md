## Working with debugger

A debugger is used to find and fix errors in software. 

We understand and solve problems:
- pause a program, check what it's doing, and see where things might go wrong. 
- examine the values of variables
- move through your code step by step.

Try in Visual Studio Code
1. Set Breakpoints -- click the left side of the line number until a red circle appears
2. Click on debug (Gear Icon) -- may need to set up your IDE
3. Inspect or watch the variable -- check the inspection and watch the window
4. Go to the next line, next breakpoint, and stop -- check the debugging control window
